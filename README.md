# Algorithmic Machine Learning
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the Algorithmic Machine Learning Course at Eurecom.

# Objectives of the course

The goal of this course is mainly to offer data science projects to students to gain hands-on experience. It nicely merges the theoretical concepts students can learn in our courses on machine learning and statistical inference, and systems concepts we teach in distributed systems

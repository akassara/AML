# House Pricing Challenge

The first AML challenge for this year is adapted from the well-known 'Zillow's Home Value Prediction' competition on Kaggle.
In particular, given a dataset containing descriptions of homes on the US property market, your task is to make predictions on the selling
price of as-yet unlisted properties. Developing a model which accurately fits the available training data while also generalising to
unseen data-points is a multi-faceted challenge that involves a mixture of data exploration, pre-processing, model selection, and 
performance evaluation.
